## üöÄ Deployment

**Current Version:** 1.15.3
**Deployed To:** `/home/david/.local/lib/browsermcp-enhanced/`
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed and running

**To Use:**
1. Restart Claude Desktop (to reload MCP servers)
2. Open Chrome Canary (extension should show green icon + badge count)
3. Open multiple Claude Desktop windows
4. Each window connects to a different port (8765-8775)

---

## üîß Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration
Located: `~/.claude/mcp_servers.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browsermcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/home/david/.local/lib/browsermcp-enhanced/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BROWSERMCP_ENHANCED": "true",
        "BROWSERMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "INFO",
        "BROWSERMCP_LOG_FILE": "true",
        "BROWSERMCP_LOG_DIR": "/tmp/browsermcp-logs"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Log Levels
- `ERROR` - Only errors
- `WARN` - Errors + warnings
- `INFO` - Normal operation (recommended)
- `DEBUG` - Detailed debugging
- `TRACE` - Very verbose (all messages)

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Port Range:** Limited to 11 concurrent instances (ports 8765-8775)
   - Can be increased by modifying port range in code

2. **Manual Restart:** Chrome extension requires manual reload after updates
   - Automated with `./scripts/chrome-canary-restart.sh`

3. **No Cross-Instance Communication:** Instances are completely isolated
   - This is by design, not a bug

### Not Yet Implemented
- ‚ùå Automatic instance load balancing
- ‚ùå Instance health monitoring dashboard
- ‚ùå Distributed tracing across instances
- ‚ùå Chaos testing framework

---

## üìà Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage Per Instance
- **Memory:** ~50-80 MB per MCP server process
- **CPU:** Negligible when idle, <5% during operations
- **Disk:** Log files ~1-5 MB per hour (depending on activity)

### Scalability
- **Tested:** Up to 4 concurrent instances
- **Theoretical Max:** 11 instances (port range limitation)
- **Recommended:** 2-4 instances for normal use

### Latency
- **Connection Time:** <100ms to establish WebSocket
- **Tool Call Overhead:** <10ms for multi-instance routing
- **Lock Acquisition:** <50ms when uncontested, <5s when queued

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental Fixes:** Fixing one issue at a time made progress trackable
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Having both automated and manual tests
3. **Detailed Logging:** Made debugging much easier
4. **Documentation:** Clear docs help with maintenance

### What Was Challenging
1. **Race Conditions:** Tab cleanup timing was tricky to get right
2. **Atomic Operations:** Port registry required careful file handling
3. **Instance Validation:** Ensuring messages route to correct instance
4. **Testing Setup:** Creating proper test infrastructure took time

### Best Practices Established
1. Always use per-connection state (no shared objects)
2. Lock release must happen AFTER resource cleanup
3. Validate instance IDs at every message boundary
4. Log everything with instance context
5. Test with multiple concurrent connections
