# Codex MCP Image Fix - Successfully Applied! âœ…

## Problem Solved
When MCP tools (like browser screenshot) returned images, Codex was converting them to JSON strings instead of treating them as actual images. This caused the model to receive text like `"[{\"type\":\"image\",\"data\":\"base64...\"}]"` instead of the actual visual content.

## Root Cause
In `/tmp/codex/codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs`, the function `convert_call_tool_result_to_function_call_output_payload` was converting ALL MCP content (including images) to JSON strings, destroying the image structure.

## The Fix
Added two new functions and modified the MCP result processing:

1. **`contains_mcp_images()`** - Detects if MCP result contains image content
2. **`convert_mcp_images_to_content_items()`** - Properly converts images to Codex's `ContentItem::InputImage` format
3. Modified the MCP result handler to route image-containing results through the proper image support system

## What Changed
- When MCP tools return images, they're now converted to proper `ContentItem::InputImage` with data URIs
- Text content is preserved as `ContentItem::OutputText`
- Non-image results continue using the original string-based flow

## Installation
The patched Codex version `0.38.1-mcp-image-fix` has been installed at:
- `/usr/local/bin/codex` - Main binary (replaced)
- `/usr/local/bin/codex-mcp-fixed` - Backup of patched version
- `/usr/bin/codex.backup-0.38.0` - Original backup

## Testing
You can now test with:
```bash
# Use browser MCP to take a screenshot
codex "take a screenshot of a website using browser MCP"

# The image should now be visible in Codex output, not JSON text!
```

## Files Modified
- `/tmp/codex/codex-rs/core/src/codex.rs` - Added image detection and conversion functions
- `/tmp/codex/codex-rs/Cargo.toml` - Updated version to `0.38.1-mcp-image-fix`

## Next Steps
1. Test with browser MCP screenshots to verify images are displayed correctly
2. Submit a PR to the Codex repository with this fix
3. The fix handles all MCP tools that return images, not just browser screenshots

## Technical Details
The fix intercepts MCP `CallToolResult` responses and:
- Checks if they contain `ContentBlock::ImageContent`
- If yes, creates proper image messages with `data:image/jpeg;base64,...` URLs
- If no, uses the original text-only conversion

This preserves backward compatibility while enabling proper image support for MCP tools.
