Project: BrowserMCP Enhanced

## Project Overview
Browser automation MCP server with Chrome extension for web interaction. Currently experiencing issues with element clicking functionality.

## Technology Stack

## Current Issue
- browser_click reports success but doesn't actually click elements
- JavaScript direct clicks work (document.querySelector().click())
- OAuth window should open but doesn't with browser_click
